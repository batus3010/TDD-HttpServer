This project is a simple HTTP server built using Go, following Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. 
The server allows you to track the number of games won by players and provides 
endpoints to interact with the data. Stored data comes from a poker CLI game and web browser interface.


**Persistence**:
   - Player data is stored in a JSON file (`game.db.json`) for persistence.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI)**:
   - Play poker and record wins via a CLI (incoming web browser interface)
