    Make PostgresPlayerStore implement PlayerStore
    TDD the functionality so you're sure it works
    Plug it into the integration test, check it's still ok

    Given rules:
    - at certain time intervals all the players need to be informed of a steadily increasing "blind" value. (DONE)
    - application will help keep track of when the blind should go up, and how much it should be. (DONE)
    - When it starts it asks how many players are playing.
    This determines the amount of time there is before the "blind" bet goes up
        + There is a base amount of time of 5 minutes.
        + For every player, 1 minute is added.
        + e.g 6 players equals 11 minutes for the blind
    - After the blind time expires the game should alert the players the new amount the blind bet is.
    - The blind starts at 100 chips, then 200, 400, 600, 1000, 2000 and continue to double until the game ends
