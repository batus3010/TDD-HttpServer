// TODO 1. write test and implement /delete/{player} handler

// TODO 2.take some effort to prevent concurrency errors like these
    fatal error: concurrent map read and map write
    superfluous response.writeheader call

// TODO 3.take this forward and pick a data store to persist the scores
    Postgres?
    Make PostgresPlayerStore implement PlayerStore
    TDD the functionality so you're sure it works
    Plug it into the integration test, check it's still ok
    Finally plug it into main
